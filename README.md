# Exp_scripts
Procedures for descriptive and inferential analysis of experimental data.  

The repo includes R code (and Markdown files) that detail multiple procedures when analyzing experimental data. 
The main data file (.csv) is based on an experiment conducted by the author on June 2019.  

Two R code files detail procedures to generate random datasets that can be analyzed with the procedures from the main analysis script.  
Both random datasets are creates with the R package 'fabricatr' (Blair et al. 2019).
